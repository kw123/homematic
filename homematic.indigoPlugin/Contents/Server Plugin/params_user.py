### replace xxx c to define you button device, or delete the entries if not used
### you can define any new device here mapping it to an existing device
###   eg HMIP-PS is a simple relay, a device mapped to that would be:
###   "HMIP-mydev": 	"HMIP-PS",
###  dont forget to add a >>,<<  after each line besides the last one.
